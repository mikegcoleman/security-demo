# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This appears to be a security demonstration repository with a minimal structure containing two main directories:
- `app/` - Application code directory
- `infra/` - Infrastructure-related code directory

## Current State

The repository is currently empty or contains only directory structure. No source files, configuration files, or documentation have been found. This suggests the repository is either:
- Newly initialized for a security demonstration project
- A skeleton structure waiting for implementation
- Recently cleaned/reset

## Development Workflow

Since no package.json, Makefile, or other build configuration files are present, standard development commands cannot be determined from the current codebase. When files are added to this repository, common commands should be documented here.

## Architecture Notes

The basic directory structure suggests a separation between application logic (`app/`) and infrastructure concerns (`infra/`), which is a common pattern for security-focused projects that may involve:
- Application security demonstrations
- Infrastructure security configurations
- Security tooling and automation

Future development should maintain this separation and follow security best practices appropriate for demonstration purposes.
